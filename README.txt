Britt Cyr Chess

This is a project I did while commuting to work this summer to try to beat a chess player I wrote in high school.

To run, Main.main();

To make a move, you need to type the start square <enter> end square <enter>
Square is a letter for the column and number for row. No spaces
a1 is bottom left, h8 is top right
